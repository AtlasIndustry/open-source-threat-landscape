- **Vulnerabilities:**  
  - SonicWall SSLVPN devices are being actively exploited through a long-standing vulnerability, with Akira ransomware groups abusing weak/default configurations.

## Implications
- **Operational:** Organizations running vulnerable SonicWall or SharePoint environments face immediate risk of compromise and should prioritize patching, configuration audits, and access restrictions.  
- **Strategic:** The rise of AI-enabled phishing and increasing law enforcement actions (e.g., U.S. DOJ bounties) signal both an escalation in attacker capability and growing geopolitical consequences for cybercrime.
